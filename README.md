# doom-to-sh
 A simple tool for creating .sh files from Doom mods combinations.
 
## How it works
This tool picks the selected Source Port, iwad and mod files to create a .sh file for it, this can be used in game launcher tools such as Heroic Games Launcher.

This program does not aim to replace tools like **ZDL**.

It saves files in Linux shellscript (.sh) and Windows batch (.bat).
